The project is designed to provide a robust, scalable and maintainable solution for an e-commerce webshop application. The microservices architecture allows for separation of concerns and efficient management of different components of the system. The Order service handles the processing and management of customer orders, while the Inventory service manages the stock levels and availability of products. The Product service is responsible for managing the catalog of products available on the webshop. Utilizing Spring Boot and Spring Web, the project facilitates communication between the services through RESTful web interfaces, enabling a seamless flow of data throughout the system.
